# VBA-Assignment
This project involves creating a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock.
The script also includes functionality to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". Additionally, the script uses conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Getting Started

To use this script, download or clone the code from the repository and open the stock_analysis.xlsm file in Microsoft Excel. The alphabetical_testing.xlsx dataset is included in the repository for testing purposes.

Usage
Open the stock_analysis.xlsm file in Microsoft Excel.
Click on the "Stock Analysis" button on the "Stocks" worksheet.
The script will run and output the results for the selected year. The results will include the ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each stock. The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume" will also be displayed.
Conditional formatting will be applied to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Performance
The script has been optimized to run efficiently on large datasets. It has been tested on the alphabetical_testing.xlsx dataset and runs in under 3 to 5 minutes.
